# Frontend Mentor Challenges
## Hello!
I have mostly worked with backend development for almost a year now, but I decided to try several frontend development challenges by Frontend Mentor. This was recommended by a friend from college and I am glad to try it out to improve my software skillset and gain knowledge of User readability, user interface and responsive design.
